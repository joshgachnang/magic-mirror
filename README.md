# Magic Mirror

This is a client for running a magic mirror display. It uses React on the frontend to run the mirror itself. The backend is controlled by a [chatbot framework](http://github.com/pcsforeducation/val) written in NodeJS.

Magic-Mirror has a few modules currently:

* Time
* Current weather and forecast
* Google calendar
* Inspirational quotes
* Chicago "L" transit schedule

Feel free to add more functionality and submit a pull request!

Inspired by Michael Teeuw's [magic mirror post](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror).

This module is intended to be served up by [Val](http://github.com/pcsforeducation/val) and gets configuration from that chatbot.
